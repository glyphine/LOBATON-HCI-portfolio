<h1 align = "center"> CS152: HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION </h1>

Welcome to my compilation of work. This file contains the entirety of my submissions for each formative, deliverable, and summative assessment. It showcases the overall development and execution of our prototype application, which we have named StudyMatch.


ðŸ“– StudyMatch is designed to enhance the learning experience by connecting students with similar study goals, facilitating group studies, and providing a platform for collaborative learning. Through this prototype, we aim to foster a supportive and interactive educational environment.
