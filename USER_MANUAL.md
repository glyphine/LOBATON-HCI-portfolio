## INTRODUCTION 

Study Match is a user-friendly application prototype available on both Android and iOS platforms, developed by Gwyn Lobaton and Jonas

Rusiana of Team Iced Tea Pioneers.This app facilitates a connection between tutors and students, providing support in subjects where 

students need help. Its primary goal is to assist students struggling with specific subjects while enabling tutors to earn money by 

offering their tutoring services at their chosen hourly rates. The app matches students with tutors based on location, the tutor's 

expertise, special needs cases, and budget. Additionally, it includes a search option allowing users to find tutors by location or skill.
